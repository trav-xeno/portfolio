          Hello, My name is Trvis Nevins.<br />
          I graduted from Univeristy of New hampshire in teh feild of
          Information Technology. Learning about new technologies, programmign
          langngues, and doing research is some of my hobbies. I loves dogs and
          cats. Curretnly I have a six year old golden named Mathis. He loves
          teh snow and travels. You will not meet a better behaved dog, unless
          you see him in hyper mode. time Three are many things out in the world
          todo and I try todo everything once.
        </p>
        <p class="grid-item-about item3-about">
          Swimming, hockey, soccer, hiking are just some of muy favorite
          activites. If you asked me about my favorite TV show was I
          would give you list, but if I had to choose Firefly would have to be
          number one.
